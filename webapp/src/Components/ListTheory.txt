Trying to create a list of items that will keep track of themselves. 

This will be used to delete themselves if the x is pressed. The only thing is they need to know their 
own information somehow. 

When the button is clicked, it needs to use a function that is held in the parent and will remove the 
entity depending on the uid passed in. Then it doesnt need to know its own value, but will pass
it back up the parent and remove itself. This will remove any need to keep and list information in
each component 

Now that there is context involved. The first item should be prepared and Then
it can be displayed by accessing the state directly. Hopefully this will
help to make sure the first item will always render

TODO 
//DONE// 1. Create an initial list item so there will always be one item displayed
//DONE// 2. Create function to add more list items as needed 
//CURRENT// 3. Create function to remove a specific list item given its current uid to get the index 
                and then remove it
